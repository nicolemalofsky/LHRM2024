Research data and associated figures/tables for this report are divided into subfolders associated with each figure or table included in the report (except one subfolder associated with supplemental data without an associated figure/table). The subfolders include the following: image or figure document file, raw research data, and analyzed research data.

Raw research data from QuantStudio PCR+melt are found in .xls files within the “Raw Data” folders. Sample Cq from PCR is found in the “Results” tab under the “CT” (quantification cycle) column. Raw data for plotting PCR product amplification is included in the “Amplification Data” tab for “Target Name[s]” ending in “LCGR.” PCR product melt temperature analyzed by standard HRM is found in the “Melt Curve Result” tab under the “Tm” (melt temperatures) column for samples with “Target Name[s]” ending in “LCGR”. Raw data for plotting PCR product melting is included in the “Melt Curve Raw Data” tab for “Target Name[s]” ending in “LCGR.” 
Raw data for L-DNA melt measurements are included in the “Melt Curve Raw Data” tab for “Target Name[s]” ending in “TXR.” 

“Analyzed Data” folders for the LHRM method include .xlsx files that convert raw data for L-DNA melt measurements into the time-scale. These .xlsx files are pulled into Savitsky-Golay analysis (.m files) for LHRM. 

Some “Analyzed Data” folders have “Summary Data…” folders that summarize data analysis for the associated HRM method.

Some “Analyzed Data” folders have “Sensitivity and specificity analysis” folders that detail the melt data sets (.xlsx) and associated analysis (.ipynb) for the associated HRM method’s sensitivity and specificity analysis.
